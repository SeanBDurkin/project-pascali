#summary Pascali Grammar Definition.
= Introduction =

This grammar is defined using the notation given by ISO/IEC 14977 : 1996(E) 1st edition, with the following exceptions/extensions:
 # Character range.
    A characater range can be defined like so...
        some letters = "a" .. "d";
    This would be equivalent to
        some letters = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d";
 # Unicode character
    Unicode characters can be defined using the unicode notation for character by codepoint number like so... 
        apos = U+0027;
 # Unicode version. This definition uses the unicode database version 6.2. Programs in the Pascali language can use any version of the unicode database from 6.2 upwards.
